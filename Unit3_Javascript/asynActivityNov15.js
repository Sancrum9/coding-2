//## Async Activity November 8th, 2024 ##
//inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 
//asyncActivityNov11.py OR asyncActivityNov11.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 

//Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 

//The following async questions are program agnostic (meaning that
//the questions can be answered regardless of which programming language you are learning)

//Good luck.

//1. A company is developing a security system that requires 2 factor authorization. This means that the system needs to verify that 2 pieces of data are correct for the person to enter the building. 
// When someone approached the building they need to have the correct name and correct passcode to enter the building. 
//Which operator would be used here? Please provide a code example of how you would write this and output the result using the print() function for python or the console.log() function for javascript? 

//* Hint the value will need to return true
function securitySystem(){
    if()
}

//2. A hospital needs to keep track of medical equipment. they are getting a shipment of new ECG machines and Oxygen tanks and need to verify. If they have more than whats needed in their office, they need to send the overflow of equipment back to the manufacturer, but if they have less, the need to request more.
//In this scenario, they are supposed to have 10 ECG machines, but only recieved 4, and for the oxygen tanks they are supposed to have 6 in stock, but recieved 9. Which operator would be used here? Please provide a code example of how you would write this and output the result using the print() function for python or the console.log() function for javascript? 

//3. A company is developing a messaging app that allows people to send text message for free. They need to allow users to capture the user data and then send it to someone else. Which operator would be used here? Please provide a code example of how you would write this and output the result using the print() function for python or the console.log() function for javascript? 

 
//## for student's learning Python
//4. Use W3 schools to research the input function. then create 2  variable that will contain the values/ data from your inputs. The data you pass in should be your name and your age. Lastly, use string concatenation to combine the new variable you created with the sentence below.

//for students learning Python
//print('my name is' + name '.  I am ' + age + 'years old.' )

//## for student's learning JavaScript
//4. Identify and explain what each of these symbols are
//- =
//- &&
//- ||
//- ==
