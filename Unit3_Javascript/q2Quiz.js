str="Arithmatic and Logic"
//7. Which operator would work best for the following function:

str="Comparison"
//8. You have been hired by Github to help them fix their password system. They would like you to create A
//   function that will check how long a password is. Your program should be able to accept a alpha-numeric password
//   and check if the password is more or less than 10 characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters,
//   your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the password is under 4 characters the
//   function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria, there should
//   be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully.

//HINT - you will need to use a function that counts the number of characters in a string. I recommend looking this up on W3schools.

//9. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a federal income tax function for a tax agency. They would like to be able
//to take in a user's annual income ammount and check how much money a person will need to pay in taxes based on the amount passed into the function.

//Provided are income amounts and how much they will be taxed:

//- If a user makes between 0.00 and 12000.00 per year, they will be taxed 10%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

//- If a user makes between 12001.00 and 50000.00 per year, they will be taxed 12%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

//- If a user makes between 50001.00 and 103000.00, they will be taxed 22%, plus and additional 3% for the state.

//- If a user makes between 103001.00 and 198000.00, they will be taxed 23%, plus and additional 3% for the state. 

//Your function should return how much money the person owes in taxes based on the amount of money they provided. 
function incomeTax(income){
    if(income <= 12000.00)
        console.log("You will be taxed 10%")
    else if(income ) 
}
//10. You have applied to several colleges in the state of PA and as your final project, you must create a function
//   that will inform you on whether you will be admitted into the school based on the schools' reccomendation letter
//   criteria. Your function should take in the name of the school along with whether it is TRUE or FALSE that you recieved 
//  a reccomendation letter from one of the staff members at Boys Latin.
